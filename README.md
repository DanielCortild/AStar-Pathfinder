# PyGame A* Pathfinder Visualization

To run the project, simply run `main.py`

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* PyGame 2.0.0

## Usage

The A* Pathfinder Algorithm Visualization tool works as following:
* Left click on any node to mark it
  - First node marked is the "Start Node"
  - Second node marked is the "End Node"
  - All other nodes marked are "Barrier Nodes"
* Right click on any node to unmark it
* Press the space key to start the algorithm
* Press the C key to clear the screen

The nodes are colour-marked as follows:
* Orange = Start Node
* Turquoise = End node
* Black = Barrier Node
* Purple = Path Node
* White = Empty Node
* Green = Open Node (Still in consideration)
* Red = Closed Node (Not in consideration anymore)
